        <h2>Battery Technology Advancements</h2>
        <p>
          Electric vehicles (EVs) rely on lithium-ion batteries, but research
          into solid-state batteries promises higher energy density, faster
          charging, and longer lifespans. Companies like Toyota and QuantumScape
          are leading the way in developing this next-generation battery
          technology.

        <h2>Charging Infrastructure Growth</h2>
        <p>
          The expansion of public charging networks is critical for widespread
          EV adoption. Companies like Tesla (with Superchargers) and initiatives
          like Electrify America are building fast-charging stations, while
          governments worldwide are investing in EV infrastructure to ensure
          convenience for drivers

        <h2>Environmental Impact</h2>
        <p>
          While EVs produce zero tailpipe emissions, the environmental impact of
          mining materials like lithium, cobalt, and nickel for batteries
          remains a concern. Recycling programs and efforts to develop
          alternative battery chemistries are key to making EVs more
          sustainable.

      A car powered by one or more electric motors that are supplied with
      electricity stored in a traction battery. The abbreviations EV (Electric
      Vehicle) or BEV (Battery Electric Vehicle) are used for these vehicles.
